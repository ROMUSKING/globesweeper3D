## 🐛 Issues Encountered & Resolutions

### 1. Duplicate Function Declaration

**Issue**: Compilation error - "Function '_input' has the same name as a previously declared function"
**Root Cause**: Two `_input` functions existed in main.gd
**Resolution**: Removed the incomplete first function, kept the complete second function
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### 2. Godot CLI Access

**Issue**: `godot` command not recognized in terminal
**Root Cause**: Godot executable not in system PATH
**Resolution**: Updated VS Code tasks.json with full executable path
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### 3. Audio System Errors

**Issue**: Audio playback errors - "Player is inactive. Call play() before requesting get_stream_playback()"
**Root Cause**: AudioStreamPlayer.play() was called after get_stream_playback(), but Godot requires play() to be called first
**Resolution**: Reordered audio playback calls in all sound functions
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### 4. Performance Monitoring Compatibility

**Issue**: `RENDER_TOTAL_VERTICES_IN_FRAME` constant not available in Godot 4.4.1
**Root Cause**: Performance monitor constant doesn't exist in this Godot version
**Resolution**: Replaced with placeholder value, kept other metrics functional
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### 5. Syntax Errors from Code Corruption

**Issue**: Parse errors due to corrupted code from previous edits
**Root Cause**: Incomplete code fragments left in script during editing
**Resolution**: Cleaned up malformed code and fixed indentation
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### 6. CSG Mesh Rendering Issues

**Issue**: Complex CSG compound meshes causing display problems
**Root Cause**: CSG operations too complex for real-time rendering
**Resolution**: Simplified to single CylinderMesh with hexagonal shape
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### 7. Terminal Command Interruption

**Issue**: PowerShell commands getting interrupted during execution
**Root Cause**: Terminal session management issues
**Resolution**: Used Start-Process for background execution
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

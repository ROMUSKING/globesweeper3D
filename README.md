## 🎮 Overview

GlobeSweeper 3D transforms the traditional Minesweeper experience into a spherical adventure. Instead of a flat grid, mines are hidden on the surface of a 3D globe composed of hexagonal tiles arranged in an icosphere pattern. Navigate the globe, reveal tiles, and avoid mines in this innovative twist on a classic game.

## ✨ Features

### Core Gameplay

- **Classic Mechanics**: Flag mines, reveal safe tiles, chord reveals, and flood-fill

### Visual & Interactive

- **3D Rendering**: Built with Godot's Forward+ renderer
- **Material System**: Distinct visual states for unrevealed, revealed, flagged, and mine tiles
- **Mouse Controls**: Click to reveal, right-click to flag, drag to rotate globe
- **Touch Support**: Mobile-friendly touch controls with double-tap reveals
- **Fireworks Effects**: Celebratory particle effects when you win

### User Interface

- **Real-time Mine Counter**: Shows remaining mines to flag
- **Game Status Display**: Win/lose messages with visual feedback
- **Reset Functionality**: Quick restart button to start a new game

## 🎯 Game Mechanics

### Objective

Reveal all safe tiles without triggering any mines. Flag all mines to win.

### Tile States

- **Unrevealed**: Dark gray hexagonal tiles
- **Revealed**: Light blue tiles showing numbers (1-8) indicating adjacent mines
- **Flagged**: Red tiles marked as potential mines
- **Mine**: Dark red tiles (revealed when game ends)

### Special Rules

- **Empty Tiles**: Tiles with 0 adjacent mines trigger flood-fill reveal
- **Chord Reveal**: Double-click numbered tiles to reveal all unflagged neighbors
- **Win Condition**: All safe tiles revealed
- **Lose Condition**: Mine tile revealed

### Globe Configuration

- **Radius**: 20 units (configurable)
- **Subdivision Level**: 3 (configurable, affects tile count)
- **Mine Percentage**: 15% (configurable)
- **Tile Scale**: 1.8 (configurable)

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Export Variables (in main.gd)

```gdscript
@export var globe_radius: float = 20.0      # Globe size
@export var subdivision_level: int = 3      # Detail level (2-5 recommended)
@export var mine_percentage: float = 0.15   # Mine density (0.1-0.3 recommended)
@export var tile_scale: float = 1.8         # Visual tile size multiplier
```

### Performance Tuning

- Lower subdivision levels for better performance
- Adjust mine percentage for difficulty
- Modify globe radius for different viewing distances

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Materials

- **Unrevealed**: Metallic gray with subtle roughness
- **Revealed**: Light blue with smooth finish
- **Flagged**: Bright red for visibility
- **Mine**: Dark red with metallic sheen

### Lighting

- **Directional Light**: Main illumination source
- **Camera Positioning**: Automatic placement at 3x globe radius
- **Environment**: Default Godot environment settings

## 📱 Mobile Support

The game includes touch controls optimized for mobile devices:

- **Single Tap**: Reveal tile
- **Double Tap**: Chord reveal
- **Touch Drag**: Rotate globe
- **Responsive UI**: Adapts to different screen sizes

## 🏗 Architecture

### Main Components

#### Main.gd (569 lines)

- **Globe Generation**: Icosphere creation and subdivision
- **Game Logic**: Mine placement, neighbor calculation, win/lose detection
- **Input Handling**: Mouse and touch event processing
- **Visual Effects**: Fireworks and material management

#### UI.gd

- **HUD Management**: Mine counter and game status display
- **Button Handling**: Reset functionality
- **State Updates**: Real-time UI updates during gameplay

### Key Algorithms

#### Icosphere Generation

1. Start with icosahedron vertices and faces
2. Subdivide each triangular face into 4 smaller triangles
3. Project vertices onto unit sphere
4. Convert triangular faces to hexagonal tiles

#### Neighbor Detection

1. Build adjacency graph from icosphere face edges
2. Calculate exact neighbor relationships
3. Use graph traversal for flood-fill reveals

#### Mine Placement

1. Random distribution based on percentage
2. Ensure fair distribution across globe surface
3. Calculate neighbor mine counts for all tiles
